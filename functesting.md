# Functional testing

This type of testing evaluates whether the devices are performing the intended functions and features as specified in the standard. For example, functional testing could include testing whether a PoE-enabled IoT device can receive power and network connectivity through a single Ethernet cable, and whether it is able to transmit and receive data over the network.
